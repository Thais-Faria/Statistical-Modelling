abstract = "Schizophrenia is a complex, devastating brain disorder with clear genetic and environmental contributions to the emergence of the disease. In the last several decades of research hundreds of millions of dollars were spent of the elusive search for schizophrenia susceptibility genes, but the results have been meager. Researchers have identified a number of genetic variants that predispose the brain to developing the disease, yet alone they can explain only a very small number of the schizophrenia occurrence. Vulnerability in DISC1, NRG1, DTNBP1, RGS4, KCNH2, COMT,'licated across multiple cohorts and do not lead to altered protein structure. In summary, we argue that large-scale genetic studies will not provide us with the answers we seek: we have to accept that there are no schizophrenia-predisposing genes with large effect sizes, and due to the diversity of findings, genetics-based novel therapies of schizophrenia are not realistic. The new treatments will have to come from functional studies of intracellular pathways and understanding the confluence of environmental influences and genetic predisposition, and their combined effects on developmental mechanisms and intracellular cascades.",

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most heritable mental illnesses, but the elucidation of its genetic basis has proven to be a very challenging endeavor. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of BD, providing the first reproducible evidence of specific genetic markers and a highly polygenic architecture that overlaps with that of schizophrenia, major depression, and other disorders. Individual GWAS markers appear to confer little risk, but common variants together account for about 25\% of the heritability of BD. A few higher-risk associations have also been identified, such as a rare copy number variant on chromosome 16p11.2. Large scale next-generation sequencing studies are actively searching for other alleles that confer substantial risk. As our understanding of the genetics of BD improves, there is growing optimism that some clear biological pathways will emerge, providing a basis for future studies aimed at molecular diagnosis and novel therapeutics.},

Corrado Gini introduced his index for the first time in a 1912 book published in Italian under the name of “Variabilità e Mutabilità” (Variability and Mutability). This article provides selected extracts of Part I of the book dedicated to measures of variability. We find that Gini proposed no less than 13 formulations of his index, none of which is known today to the large public. We also find that Gini anticipated some of the developments that derived from the study of his index.},

Although prevailing indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) cannot detect or easily explain such patterns, relational theories of social class, which emphasise political-economic processes and dimensions of power, might. We test whether the relational construct of contradictory class location, which embodies aspects of both ownership and labour, can explain this nonlinear pattern. Data on full-time workers from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 21859) show that occupants of contradictory class locations have higher prevalence and odds of depression and anxiety than occupants of non-contradictory class locations. These findings suggest that the effects of class relations on depression and anxiety extend beyond those of SES, pointing to under-studied mechanisms in social epidemiology, for example, domination and exploitation.},

    abstract = { Genome-wide-association studies (GWASs), epigenetic, gene-expression and gene–gene interaction projects, nutritional genomics and investigations of the gut microbiota have increased our knowledge of the pathophysiology of eating disorders (EDs). However, compared with anorexia nervosa, genetic studies in patients with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are relatively scarce, with the exception of a few formal genetic and small-sized candidate–gene-association studies. In this article, we review important findings derived from formal and molecular genetics in order to outline a genetics-based pathophysiological model of EDs. This model takes into account environmental and nutritional factors, genetic factors related to the microbiome, the metabolic and endocrine system, the immune system, and the brain, in addition to phenotypical traits of EDs. Shortcomings and advantages of genetic research in EDs are discussed against the historical background, but also in light of potential future treatment options for patients with EDs. }

abstract = {Abstract Anxiety and depression share a long, close history in psychiatric nosology and treatment. The anxiety disorders, individually and as a group, exhibit remarkably high rates of comorbidity with each other and with major depression. Analyses done in large-scale epidemiologic surveys have identified major patterns of phenomenological overlap between these conditions. Researchers have tested hypotheses of shared genetic etiologies as a potential basis of this relationship. In general, available family studies have found mixed evidence for co-aggregation of anxiety and depressive disorders, while twin studies more definitively indicate that shared genetic risk factors largely account for this comorbidity. Some of this appears to be accounted for by genetic variation in personality traits that broadly predispose to anxiety and depression. Molecular genetic studies of these conditions, though too early to draw firm conclusions, thus far provide tentative support for specific genetic loci that may generally influence susceptibility across the anxiety-depressive spectrum. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
