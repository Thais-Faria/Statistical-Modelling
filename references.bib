abstract = "Schizophrenia is a complex, devastating brain disorder with clear genetic and environmental contributions to the emergence of the disease. In the last several decades of research hundreds of millions of dollars were spent of the elusive search for schizophrenia susceptibility genes, but the results have been meager. Researchers have identified a number of genetic variants that predispose the brain to developing the disease, yet alone they can explain only a very small number of the schizophrenia occurrence. Vulnerability in DISC1, NRG1, DTNBP1, RGS4, KCNH2, COMT,'licated across multiple cohorts and do not lead to altered protein structure. In summary, we argue that large-scale genetic studies will not provide us with the answers we seek: we have to accept that there are no schizophrenia-predisposing genes with large effect sizes, and due to the diversity of findings, genetics-based novel therapies of schizophrenia are not realistic. The new treatments will have to come from functional studies of intracellular pathways and understanding the confluence of environmental influences and genetic predisposition, and their combined effects on developmental mechanisms and intracellular cascades.",

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most heritable mental illnesses, but the elucidation of its genetic basis has proven to be a very challenging endeavor. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of BD, providing the first reproducible evidence of specific genetic markers and a highly polygenic architecture that overlaps with that of schizophrenia, major depression, and other disorders. Individual GWAS markers appear to confer little risk, but common variants together account for about 25\% of the heritability of BD. A few higher-risk associations have also been identified, such as a rare copy number variant on chromosome 16p11.2. Large scale next-generation sequencing studies are actively searching for other alleles that confer substantial risk. As our understanding of the genetics of BD improves, there is growing optimism that some clear biological pathways will emerge, providing a basis for future studies aimed at molecular diagnosis and novel therapeutics.},
